Including examples of how these skills were utilized or developed would make the resume more well-rounded.\n",

      "2. Include relevant work experience: If applicable, include any professional work experience or internships, even if they are not directly related to computer science. Highlight the skills and experiences gained during these roles that are transferable to the desired position.\n",

      "3. Showcase soft skills: Include a section or incorporate soft skills throughout the resume.

This could include examples of teamwork, leadership, problem-solving, or effective communication.\n",
